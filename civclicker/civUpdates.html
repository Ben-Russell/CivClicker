<h1>CivClicker Updates</h1>
	<h2>2014-04-24: v1.1.13 (alpha)</h2>
	<p>
		Worker (and zombie) spawn buttons now include a 'Max' option (which
		operates in O(lg(n)) time, which should be acceptably responsive)
	</p>
	<p>
		Corpses are now treated as a resource, rather than a population unit.
		Unfortunately, this slightly breaks compatibility with prior versions;
		v1.1.13+ will load prior save games, but prior versions will lose their
		corpses if they try to load a v1.1.13+ save game.
	</p>
	<p>
		Moved the displays for happiness, free land, and zombies to be in more 
		useful places.
	</p>
	<p>
		Removed the panel subheadings; they were taking up space, and not
		conveying useful information.
	</p>
	<p>
		All costs are now calculated to full precision, although the display is
		rounded to the nearest integer.  Button emable/disable is also now
		performed on the unrounded values, so users may occasionally see that
		button enable/disable effects are not perfectly synchronized with the
		number displayed.  This is because the enable/disable uses the exact
		value, whereas the number displayed rounded first.
	</p>
	<p>
		Fix the dynamic cost updates broken by 1.1.12 changes.
	</p>
	<p>
		Fix the background so it stretches to cover again.
	</p>
	<p>
		Raise Dead buttons now enable and disable properly.
	</p>
	<p>
		Replaced the worker and zombie cost iterative calculator with a
		constant-time formula version.  This should improve responsiveness
		with large numbers.
	</p>
	<p>
		Consolidated all of the assorted hire/fire functions into one.
	</p>
	<h2>2014-04-06: v1.1.12 (alpha)</h2>
	<p>
		Dynamically generate the building controls.
	</p>
	<h2>2014-04-06: v1.1.11 (alpha)</h2>
	<p>
		Fix a bug that caused the food display to be incorrectly colourized.
	</p>
	<h2>2014-04-06: v1.1.10 (alpha)</h2>
	<p>
		Fix a bug that caused the food display to display gross food production instead of
		net food.
	</p>
	<h2>2014-04-06: v1.1.9 (alpha)</h2>
	<p>
		Fix a bug that allowed people to get absurd numbers of zombies.
	</p>
	<h2>2014-04-06: v1.1.8 (alpha)</h2>
	<p>
		Adjust the stat display system to use HTML custom data attributes.
	</p>
	<h2>2014-04-04: v1.1.7 (alpha)</h2>
	<p>
		Fix some typos in the last few checkins.
	</p>
	<h2>2014-04-04: v1.1.6 (alpha)</h2>
	<p>
		Switch the background from using a pre-faded original to using CSS
		opacity.
	</p>
	<h2>2014-04-03: v1.1.5 (alpha)</h2>
	<p>
		More syntactic refactoring; no functional change.
	</p>
	<h2>2014-03-30: v1.1.4 (alpha)</h2>
	<p>
	    Removed 'Max' siege engine creation button 
		(it was too easy to accidentally click).
	</p>
	<h2>2014-03-30: v1.1.3 (alpha)</h2>
	<p>
		Refactored civilization size code.
	</p>
	<h2>2014-03-23: v1.1.2 (alpha)</h2>
	<p>
		Numerous minor JavaScript syntax fixes.
	</p>
	<h2>2014-02-15: v1.1.1 (alpha)</h2>
	<p>
		New workers now start as farmers.  This should prevent them from
		starving before starting to feed themselves, and save a lot of tedious
		clicking while growing population in the late game.
	</p>
	<p>
		Secondary resource collection should happen more smoothly as your
		empire grows.
	</p>
	<p>
		Soldiers and cavalry now return their equipment resources when
		reallocated (not when killed).
	</p>
	<p>
		Fixed a bug where if you used the +All button for Cavalry, it only
		deducted half the normal food and leather price.
	</p>
	<h2>2014-02-15: v1.1</h2>
	<p>
		I'm going to call this version 1.1 to denote the hosting change, even
		though the changes are relatively minor.
	</p>
	<p>
		Updated references to the web hosting location to point to the new
		site.
	</p>
	<p>
		Ran all the HTML and CSS through the W3C validator, and fixed the
		issues it found.
	</p>
	<p>
		Removed the Google tracking code.
	</p>
	<h2>2014-02-13: v1.0</h2>
	<p>
		Migrated CivClicker to its new home on SourceForge.
